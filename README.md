# gender-recognition using speech signal in matlab

This is the project to identify the gender of a person using real time speech signal.

Here, we have first extracted three features essentially Zero Crossing level, Short Energy Level and Fundamental Frequency from speech signal by performing different signal processing techniques and ofcourse we have designed filter to remove noise.

# Input
Human voice signal 

# Output
Display either Male or Female

Here, you have two matlab code files one is for characteristic features extraction and the other one is for gender recognition using the identified features. Download and run both the codes in matlab code simulator.

# Future Work
You can increase number of features to get more accurate results.
